# Smart Video Downloader

Well well â€” not every project has to be serious ðŸ™‚  
This is just a small script I wrote as a hobby, mainly to download videos to listen to while working.

It goes without saying:  
 Please use this little utility **only in legal contexts** and for **videos you are allowed to download**.
